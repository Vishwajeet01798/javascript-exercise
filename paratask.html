<p id="hide">Decreased production and increased costs: Food production and
 distribution have not been able to catch up with the increasing population
 and hence the costs of production have increased. Inflation is the major 
 consequence of over population.Inequitable income distribution: In the
 face of an increasing population, there is an unequal distribution of income and
 inequalities within the country widen. Due to excessive number of individuals,
 the job is not valued appropriately which could significantly bring down the 
 value of the skill.</p>
